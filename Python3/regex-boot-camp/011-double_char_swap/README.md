Double Character Swap

Write a function to replace all instances of character a with character b and vice versa.
Examples

double_swap("#", "&", "random w#rds writt&n h&r&")
➞ "random w&rds writt#n h#r#"

double_swap("8", "9", "128 895 556 788 999")
➞ "129 985 556 799 888"

Notes

Both characters will show up at least once in the string.
