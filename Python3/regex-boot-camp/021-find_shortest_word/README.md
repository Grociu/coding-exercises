Find the Shortest Word(s) in a Sentence

Create a function that accepts a string as an argument. Find its shortest 
word(s) and return them as a list sorted alphabetically (if there are multiple 
shortest words).

Rules

    Periods, commas and other special characters don't count as part of a
    word's length.
    Return words in lowercase only.
    Sort words alphabetically.

Examples

findShortestWords("The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dogs back.")
 ➞ ["fox", "the", "the"]

findShortestWords("I think the solution is fairly obvious.") ➞ ["i"]

findShortestWords("Chase two rabbits, catch none.") ➞ ["two"]

findShortestWords("We become what we think about.") ➞ ["we", "we"]

Notes

Remember to sort the list of words alphabetically before returning your result.
