Double Palindromes

Strings can be segregated into both their letter and digit components.

    A double palindrome is when a string's letter component and digit component are both palindromes.
    A single-palindrome is when either (but not both) the letter component or the digit component are palindromes.

To illustrate:

"cab97ac79"
# double-palindrome: "cabac" and "9779" are both palindromes.

"1abc4de1"
# single-palindrome: "141" is a palindrome.

Write a function that maps double palindromes to the number 2, single palindromes to the number 1, and everything else to the number 0.
Examples

palindrome_set(["cb77c", "ccc888", "ccc789", "abc89"]) ➞ [2, 2, 1, 0]

palindrome_set(["789", "555", "ccc", "abba"]) ➞ [0, 1, 1, 1]

palindrome_set(["7a", "5f", "6c"]) ➞ [2, 2, 2]

Notes

    A string is composed of only letters or only numbers, can be at most a single palindrome (see example #2).
    All single character components are trivially palindromes (see example #3).
    All letters will be lower cased.
