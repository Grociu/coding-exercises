I did a dirty hack of replacing each [] with @ and then replacing the @ with
those alternatives. There are not many solutions for this on Edabit to draw
any inspirations.

The challanges in this were constructing the result. I created the result list
as empty strings first and iterated by letter of the string. It's probably very
computationally heavy.
