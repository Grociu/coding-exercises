Wurst Is Better

Wurst is the best. Create a function that takes a string and replaces every 
mention of any type of sausage with the German word "Wurst," unless—of 
course—the sausage is already a type of German "Wurst" (i.e. "Bratwurst", see
below), then leave the sausage name unchanged.

Examples of German Wursts

    Bratwurst
    Kochwurst
    Leberwurst
    Mettwurst
    Rostbratwurst
