These exercises are designed to train the use of the regular expresions
in Python. After encountering a nasty problem that uses REGEX, I came to the
conclusion I need to learn the use of it by practice.

The following excercises are from Edabit, the idea is to write the code, and
test function, comment it, then meaningfully analyze the Edabit user solutions.
