This was easily solved without regex, but again, this is not the point of this
exercise. The tricky part was beating a testing function that had the suffxes
/prefixes inside the word (that were added by me). 

Also I learned that Edabit does not support Python 3.7 most importantly 
f-strings which is quite relevant.
