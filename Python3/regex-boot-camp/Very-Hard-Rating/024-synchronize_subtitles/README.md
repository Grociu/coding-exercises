Synchronize the Subtitles

Create a function that will increment every time format found in a string (for example 00:42:33,120) by a specific time (for example 00:00:30,550). The result between the examples is 00:43:03,670.
Rules

    The function must take 2 arguments: a string from where to search time format and a string that respects the format hours:minutes:seconds,milliseconds.
    The function must return a string identical to the first argument but with all time format incremented with the second argument time format.
    If the second argument does not respect the given time format (for example 00:00:00 or 0:0:0,000), you must return "There is a problem with the second argument".

Examples

sync_subs("708
00:44:50,006 --> 00:44:53,007
Hi.", "00:03:30,550")
➞
"708
00:45:20,556 --> 00:45:23,557
Hi."

sync_subs("179
00:12:52,766 --> 00:12:55,900
[Door rattling]", "00:11:11,111")
➞
"179
00:24:04,011 --> 00:24:07,011
[Door rattling]"

sync_subs("188
00:13:37,243 --> 00:13:39,744
30 minutes.
Everyone's ready.
189
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:43,548

", "01:00:51,111")
➞
"188
02:06:28,000 --> 02:06:30,000
30 minutes.
Everyone's ready.
189
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:34,000"

Notes

You don't need to worry about a time format being wrong in the first string like 00:13:79,779 or 00:13:39,79 because there won't be any mistake in it.
