Rhyme Time

Create a function that returns True if two lines rhyme and False otherwise. 
For the purposes of this exercise, two lines rhyme if the last word from each 
sentence contains the same vowels.
Examples

does_rhyme("Sam I am!", "Green eggs and ham.") ➞ True

does_rhyme("Sam I am!", "Green eggs and HAM.") ➞ True
# Capitalization and punctuation should not matter.

does_rhyme("You are off to the races", "a splendid day.") ➞ False

does_rhyme("and frequently do?", "you gotta move.") ➞ False

Notes

    Case insensitive.
    Here we are disregarding cases like thyme and lime.
    We are also disregarding cases like away and today (which technically 
    rhyme, even though they contain different vowels).
