Split 25 (Part 1)

About a month ago I stumbled upon an interesting problem — something called the
25 split. In the problem, you had to break up 25 into parts, and, from those 
parts, try to create the biggest product.

For example, 3 * 22 = 66 or 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 = 3125. With this first part, 
return the value of the biggest product possible using natural number parts 
from a given number, x.

Examples

split(5) ➞ 6
# 3 times 2

split(10) ➞ 36
# 3 * 3 * 4

split(1) ➞ 1

Notes

    3's are useful...
    Part 2 of this challenge is here.
