Vowel Families

Write a function that select all words that shares the same vowels
 (in any ordering) as the first word in the list.
Examples

same_vowel_group(["toe", "ocelot", "maniac"]) ➞ ["toe", "ocelot"]

same_vowel_group(["many", "carriage", "emit", "apricot", "animal"]) ➞ ["many"]

same_vowel_group(["hoops", "chuff", "bot", "bottom"]) ➞ ["hoops", "bot", "bottom"]

Notes

    Words will contain only lowercase letters, and may contain whitespaces.
    Frequency does not matter (e.g. if "loopy", then you can include words with
     any number of o's, so long as they only contain o's, and not any other 
     vowels).
