This is a README.md for exercism Python exercises.

https://exercism.io/ is a website with coding exercises for different languages. It's free of charge.
Each problem has it's own test function maintained by curators. Each solution has to fullfil the test function.
All solutions submitted are logged and are available to be seen and rated by other users. The idea is to compare your code to one of the other users and learn new techniques.

All of the original commit files were completed between 13th and 20th of April 2019.
