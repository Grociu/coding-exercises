This is an execrice designed to tst he syntax and build of the test functions. 
The original task was selected from Edabit based on the large number of tests it had.
Based on the exercism test functions and documentatons I imported the Edabit tests for this exercise,
and constructed both the solution and test function. It seems to be working.
