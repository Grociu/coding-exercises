# coding-exercises
This is my directory of completed coding exercises.

I started my coding adventure on 6th April 2019 with a Python2 course on Codecademy.
Since then I am slowly completing various exercises on code tutorial websites (mainly exercism).
This repository will contain my solutions for the given problems. This eventually will create a small library of training problems.

Folders are sorted by coding language, then by website.
